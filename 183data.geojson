The UC is the best preserved, still retaining its single theater, paneled Craftsman style lobby, and exterior terra cotta heraldic ornaments.

Ratcliff, Jr. The building was constructed in 1913 by the Alameda County Home Investment Company, which was founded by Ratcliff and his partner, Charles Louis McFarland.  The building is distinguished by its graceful façade, which echoes that of the Hearst Memorial Mining Building on the University of California campus. It was featured in the October 1914 issue of The Architect and Engineer as part of a 23-page lead article on Ratcliff’s recent work.  In the mid-1920s, Alameda County Home Investment Co. sold the Channing Apartments to John Weston Havens, a nephew of Francis K. Shattuck and heir to his estate. Following Havens’ death in 1929, the building passed into the possession of his only son, John Weston Havens, Jr., who kept it until his own death in 2001. The Havens estate sold the building in 2005.  When the Channing Apartments were built, the Ellsworth Tract and its neighboring blocks were among the most elegant neighborhoods in Berkeley. Over the decades, campus expansion has brought about the destruction of several residential Southside blocks and the degradation of many surviving buildings. The Channing Apartments now face three institutional blocks that were almost completely cleared of their original buildings for the construction of Unit 1 and Unit 2 residence halls and the Underhill parking structure and athletic field. On its own side of the street, the Channing Apartments building is the only unaltered survivor from the first half of the 20th century."},"geometry":{"coordinates":[-122.25383727116349,37.86733268980318],"type":"Point"},"id":3},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Address":"2030–2032 Bancroft Way","Landmark":"A.H. & Julia Broad House and Broad Apartment Building","Architect+Date":"Alphonso Herman Broad (1887; 1915)","Link":"https://berkeleyheritage.com/berkeley_landmarks/2017_landmarks.html","Designated":"6 April 2017","Notes":"Almost thirty years separate the two structures that Berkeley pioneer builder, civic leader, and amateur artist A.H. Broad designed and built on this parcel, which he owned for many years. The 1887 Eastlake-style Victorian house, now located at the rear of the lot, was moved from its original position at the front to make way for its younger neighbor, a flat-roofed, six-unit apartment building with Colonial Revival details in the portico and eaves.

An expressman by trade (his business card read “John Boyd, Boss Baggage Buster of Beautiful Berkeley”), John Boyd was a Civil War veteran and widely known as Berkeley’s “town philosopher.” A famous gadfly, Boyd was frequently featured in local newspapers as a poet, humorist, and writer of many letters to the editor. In addition, he was the author of the book The Berkeley Heroine. Among Boyd’s civic feats was the 1900 campaign to erect a public drinking fountain next to the downtown Berkeley train station. He even dared to solicit funds from Phoebe Apperson Hearst, whose $50 donation put the campaign in motion and led to the installation, in August 1900, of an extremely ornate fountain, replete with sea serpents, shells, and vines.  Boyd lived in his Addison Street house until his death, on 26 January 1912. His wife having died in 1907, Boyd bequeathed the house to his son, Sherman, “to have and to hold until taxes get too high on the property for it to be retained as a residence, in which case the property may be sold and the money divided.”"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[-122.27223999999939,37.87118821232029],"type":"Point"},"id":5},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Address":"2626 Bancroft Way/2625 Durant Avenue","Landmark":"University Art Museum (Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive)","Architect+Date":"Mario J.

Reiter (1967–1970)","Link":"https://berkeleyheritage.com/berkeley_landmarks/2012_landmarks.html","Designated":"2 February 2012","Notes":"The University Art Museum (BAM) is considered a masterwork of modernist design and has been called a “visual masterpiece.” In its scuptural forms, it outstandingly exemplifies the Brutalist style of its era. Especially impressive is the unique complex formed by the soaring atrium and spirals of multiple galleries and ramps, designed by Jorasch and Wagner. Also visually powerful is the building’s exterior, which strongly reflects the interior layout and presents staggered Cubist masses that rise and shift direction compellingly. BAM is a prime example of work by the office of Mario J. Ciampi (1907–2006), an important Bay Area architect and urban designer with a distinctive modernist flair.  Art historican Sidra Stich notes that “At one time the museum was the center of contemporary art activity in the Bay Area. It produced internationally significant exhibitions, had its finger on the pulse of avant-garde activity, and was an energizing hub for people and ideas [...] aspects of the [museum’s] program still focus on the current era, offering insights into contemporary ideas and modes of expression.” The museum has a continuing commitment to presenting new and experimental work. Also exceptional is the museum’s world-class Pacific Film Archive."},"geometry":{"coordinates":[-122.25585054232764,37.868785869363265],"type":"Point"},"id":6},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Address":"2277 Shattuck Avenue","Landmark":"Hezlett’s Silk Store Building","Architect+Date":"Charles F.

David R. Brower—internationally famed environmentalist, mountaineer, long-time executive director of the Sierra Club, and founder of other environmental organizations—grew up on this property that had been bought by his grandmother, Susan Brower, in 1902.  The front house, a Queen Anne-Eastlake Victorian, was built in 1887 by the notable builder, artist, and civic pioneer A.H. Broad (1851–1930). The rear house, a Berkeley Brown Shingle, was added in 1904. The two houses were altered early on for apartment use, and David Brower’s father, Ross Brower, made many additional modifications to them over the years. Ross Brower moved his family into part of the front house in 1916, when David Brower was four years old, and David lived here until joining the Army in 1942.  While living here, David Brower developed his love of nature through hiking in the Berkeley Hills and exploring Strawberry Creek. Here he began his career as a mountain climber, joined the Sierra Club, and became the first editor of its member newsletter, the Yodeler. In 1941, David Brower planted the now-towering coastal redwood that stands at the front of the property."},"geometry":{"coordinates":[-122.2638389999996,37.865178874544725],"type":"Point"},"id":8},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Address":"2726 Haste Street","Landmark":"Berkeley Piano Club","Architect+Date":"William Woollett (1912); Junk-Riddell Investment Co., designer (1913)","Link":"https://berkeleyheritage.com/berkeley_landmarks/2005_landmarks.html","Designated":"7 March 2005","Notes":"Founded in 1893 and still active, the Berkeley Piano Club is one of the nation’s few musical clubs with a private performance space.
